# Pokedex

Whole project is under global reconstruction right now. So, you know Caution! Watch under your feets! Jokes aside. Pokedex may be still quite appealing to an eye but after a half year of working on my JavaScript skills, the project has got old poorly.

I'm currently moving codebase to TypeScript while still staying with Vue 2. Beside this the API services and whole navigation / filtering system is being replaced. Due to being horribly, horribly slow.
